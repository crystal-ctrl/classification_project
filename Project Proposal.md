# Project Proposal

#### Question/need:

- Can I predict the success of Kickstarter Campaign with classification models?

- This project's goal is to help entrepreneurs/campaigners increase their chances of launching a successful campaign by narrowing down the criteria to focus with classification models.

  

#### Data Description:

- Dataset: Kickstarter dataset from the website [Web Robots](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/)

- Each unit is an individual Kickstarter Campaign. 

- Features: backer_count, category, converted_pledge_amount, country, created_at, deadline, goal, launched_at, pledged, spotlight, staff_pick

- Target: Success of the campaign

  

#### Tools:

- Sklearn classification models - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, etc.
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation
- SQL for storage
- possibly using Flask for production if time allows

#### MVP Goal:

- A baseline classification model that predicts the success of a Kickstart campaign
